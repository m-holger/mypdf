# mypdf

This is my personal development fork of qpdf. It is based on qpdf version 11.9.0. It maintains binary compatibility with
qpdf but otherwise deviates from the rules and conventions of qpdf. A broad outline will be given below, with the
details in MyChangelog.md.

qpdf is copyright (c) 2005-2024 Jay Berkenbilt. For details see NOTICE.md. The qpdf readme can be found in
QPDF-README.md.

The main purpose of this branch is to allow me to develop my thinking about qpdf and the direction in which I would like
to see it develop. This includes testing out the interaction of various ideas.
